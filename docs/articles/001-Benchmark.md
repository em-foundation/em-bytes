# EM&bull;Bytes &ndash; Benchmark[et]ing ultra-low-power

Vendor data sheets might specify that an ultra-low-power MCU draws (say) **700&thinsp;nA @ 3&thinsp;V** when in its "deep-sleep" mode.  Very nice – but until we factor in our application workload, we have no way to truly assess the impact of these MCU specs on overall energy efficiency.
