### Bite-sized posts on "tiny-code for tiny-chips"

**EM&bull;Bytes** serves as the voice of [**The EM Foundation**](#) &ndash; a 501(c)(3) non-profit which sponsors and promotes novel software technology for resource-constrained embedded systems.

Our "tiny-code for tiny-chips" mantra reflects a deep-seated belief about the current state of embedded software engineering &ndash; too much memory bloat, too much runtime overhead, and too many high-level programming APIs for the job at hand.

With so much technical debt taken on by today's embedded software libraries and stacks, next-generation MCUs have little choice but to add _more_ memory and _more_ MIPs to mitigate software's ever-expanding size and complexity.

By rethinking software development for resource-constrained hardware platforms, we look to enable a new breed of embedded applications targeting minimalistic MCUs &ndash; systems in which every byte of memory and &mu;Joule of energy impacts their cost and viability.

!!! eighth "On a personal note"

    When I began programming embedded systems in the late 1970s, most target processors had less than 32K of memory.&thinsp;  But somehow, we managed to overcome this constraint in real-world applications &ndash; taking pride in how compact we could craft our code.

    Today, of course,
