### Bite-sized posts on "tiny-code for tiny-chips"

**EM&bull;Bytes** serves as the voice of [**The EM Foundation**](https://www.openem.org/) &ndash; a 501(c)(3) non-profit which sponsors and promotes novel software technology for resource-constrained embedded systems.

Our "tiny-code for tiny-chips" mantra reflects a deep-seated belief about the current state of embedded software engineering &ndash; too much memory bloat, too much runtime overhead, and too many high-level programming APIs for the job at hand.

With so much technical debt taken on by today's legacy embedded software, next-generation MCUs have little choice but to add _more_ memory and _more_ MIPs to mitigate software's ever-expanding size and complexity.

!!! eighth "On a personal note"

    When I began programming embedded systems in the late 1970s, most target processors had less than 32K of memory.&thinsp;  But somehow, we managed to overcome this constraint in real-world applications &ndash; taking pride in how compact we could craft our code.

    Today, of course, even the most rudimentary low-power sensor tag demands at least 10&times; the memory &ndash; for application software that now includes device drivers, a wireless stack, DSP functions, and perhaps an RTOS.

    But what if we could _shrink_&thinsp; this software by an order of magnitude &ndash; and enjoy comparable reductions in power consumption and system cost&thinsp;???
    
    With "tiny-code" of this scale at hand, we can also imagine a new breed of "tiny-chips" featuring novel MCU architectures with 10&times; gains in performance and efficiency.

The articles which follow touch on a range of topics under our "tiny-code for tiny-chips" umbrella &ndash; often highlighting initiatives by the **The EM Foundation** to drive change in how we think about resource-constrained embedded systems.

We'll keep the articles short &ndash; skim them in a minute, digest them in under ten....&thinsp;  And though each post will invariably cover technical material, we'll keep the content high-level &ndash; flying at 10,000 feet, but with links to other resources for those wishing to deep-dive on the ground.
