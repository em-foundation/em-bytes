introduced EM\u2022Scope \u2013 a tool used to capture, analyze, display, and deliver real-time profiles of power-consumption.</p> <p>Measuring target embedded systems performing typical periodic tasks, EM\u2022Scope offers insights to developers and integrators alike not found in the MCU data sheet \u2013 by adding the dimension of time\u2009 to the equation.</p> <p>On a personal note</p> <p>Back in the day, I never really worried about minimizing\u2009 system power consumption when developing embedded application software.\u2009 Instead, we fixated on maximizing\u2009 processor utilization \u2013 using every available MIP to continuously perform a multitude of real-time tasks.</p> <p>In my mind, the Texas Instruments MSP430 (announced in the 1990s) set the performance standard for the ultra-low-power\u2009 microcontroller as we know it today.\u2009 If nothing else, the MSP430 stands alone as the first MCU to use items from your fridge as a power source.</p> <p>As a SW developer, the rules of the game have changed \u2013 to one in which \"doing nothing\" for the longest possible time maximizes overall energy efficiency.\u2009 Yes, we still want to execute code as quickly as possible \u2013 but now to enjoy our \"deep-sleep\" that much sooner. </p> <p>EM\u2022Scope captures real-time information via a hardware power analyzer\u2009 connected to your target MCU board as well as your host PC:</p> <p></p> EM\u2022Scope Hardware Configuration   <p>At present, the EM\u2022Scope tool supports two different analyzers \u2013 each used to record power consumption in real-time while also sourcing voltage to your target board:</p> <p> Joulescope JS220 \u00b7 a high-precision analyzer that belongs in every hardware lab</p> <p> Nordic PPK2 \u00b7 an entry-level analyzer that fits any engineer's personal budget</p> <p>To normalize measurement, EM\u2022Scope presumes your target board will repeatedly perform a single\u2009 application task of interest \u2013 entering deep-sleep mode when complete, and awakening one-second later for the next iteration.</p> <p>Breaking the problem down</p> <p>While embedded applications typically perform multiple\u2009 tasks (sensing, analyzing, logging, transmitting) at a variety of rates, measuring the power consumption of each task in isolation \u2013 akin to unit-testing \u2013 helps us construct an application-level power-profile</p> <p>Knowing the 1\u2009Hz energy profile of each task [\u2009\u03bcJ/s\u2009], we can extrapolate to other rates of activity as well as combine results to characterize the application as a whole.\u2009 Indi\u00advidual tasks, while active less than 1% of the time, can often account for over 90% of the \u03bcJ/s.</p> <p>Since periodic activity occurs once per-second, recording for as little as 10\u201315\u2009seconds should provide a reasonable raw sample set for further analysis.\u2009 Often an iterative process to finalize results, EM\u2022Scope can generate interactive plots along the way as a visual aid:</p> <p></p> Wakeup \u00b7 Execute \u00b7 Sleep    <p>This particular plot displays power consumption of a single activation of our application task of interest \u2013 in this case, a Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) advertising event which transmits the same small data packet on three different 2.4\u2009GHz channels.</p> <p>Though not obvious, the trio of 300\u2009ms radio transmissions drawing 18\u2009mW accounts for less than half the power consumed between wakeup and sleep.\u2009 Closer scrutiny revels that software execution (while only drawing 8\u2009mW) has greater impact on the overall power profile.</p> <p>If you can't see the problem, how can you fix it\u2009??</p> <p>Visualizing power consumption over time with EM\u2022Scope gives software engineers a better perspective on how optimizing their code can contribute to overall energy efficiency \u2013 independent of any improvements in the underlying hardware technology.</p>"},{"location":"articles/001-Benchmark/#quantifying-energy-efficiency","title":"Quantifying energy efficiency","text":"<p>In the spirit of CoreMark\u2009 (used for comparing CPU

EM\u2022eralds; BLE advertising at a ten-second rate scores 172.31 EM\u2022eralds.\u2009 As the duration of the period further increases, our BLE advertising score asymptotically approaches ~420 EM\u2022eralds.</p> <p>This particular example uses an MCU(1) which features extremely low current consumption when in deep-sleep.\u2009 While by no means the winner in a 1\u2009Hz race, this chip

application.</p> <p>On a personal note</p> <p>In some configurations, I've replaced the BLE stack supplied by the silicon vendor with one of my own design written in EM\u2022Script \u2013 a novel programming platform which targets resource-constrained MCUs.</p> <p>By optimizing both code size and execution time, we can potentially improve\u2009 overall energy efficiency.\u2009 EM\u2022erald scores of 43.12 and 280.50 turned in by this <code>ti-23-lp/emscript-2V2</code> capture should peak your interest \u2013 and will receive more attention in future articles.</p>"},{"location":"articles/002-BlueJoule/#helping-the-cause","title":"Helping the cause","text":"<p>If nothing else, BlueJoule fills a void in the industry \u2013 not only by streamlining comparision of one \"ultra-low-power\" BLE device against another, but also by giving us greater insight into how\u2009 these devices consume energy when executing an application workload in real-time.</p> <p>To engage at the next level, the EM\u2022Scope ReadMore shows you how to install and use this open-source tool \u2013 drawing on our <code>ti-23-lp/simplelink-3V0</code> capture as a working example.</p> <p>... and you don't need a power analyzer to start exploring the benchmark results !!!</p> <p>The BlueJoule ReadMore provides additional information for anyone wishing to submit a new\u2009 capture using EM\u2022Scope in conjunction with a JS220 or PPK2 analyzer.</p> <p>But above all, we need input from the BLE device vendors publicized by our efforts:</p> <p> \u2002 is BlueJoule a meaningful benchmark  \u2002 have we measured your device fairly  \u2002 are there other devices of interest  \u2002 how do we best interact with you</p> <p>Ideally, each vendor would deliver optimized <code>bluejoule</code> SDK projects targeting specific BLE devices within their silicon portfolio \u2013 not unlike the ever-present <code>coremark</code> projects we find.</p> <p>On a personal note</p> <p>Having prepared most of the software used in the current BlueJoule catalog, I can honestly attest to the relative difficultly of this task \u2013 given that an energy-efficient periodic advertising example should seemingly serve as the \"hello world\" of BLE.</p> <p>I often found myself dissecting sophisticated, generalized applications to finally arrive at an elementary embodiment of the BLE broadcast role.\u2009 More important, I sometimes had to add\u2009 instructions to ensure the application  enters the lowest-power sleep mode.</p> <p>As a multi-decade veteren of this industry, I understand the challenges silicon vendors can face \u2013 and would therefore offer to work with y'all in making BlueJoule a reality.</p> <p>Happy coding\u2009!!! \u2002  </p>"}]}
